            Some popular fan-made characters do not belong to any single <strong>Alternate Universe (AU)</strong>
            or <strong>Alternate Timeline (AT)</strong>. Instead, they exist <em>outside</em> individual worlds
            and act upon the multiverse itself. These figures are often portrayed as <strong>custodians</strong>,
            <strong>travelers</strong>, or even <strong>predators</strong> of realities.

              <li><strong>Position:</strong> Stand above or apart from any one AU/AT; can traverse between them.</li>
              <li><strong>Function:</strong> Influence, repair, observe, or dismantle universes and timelines.</li>
              <li><strong>Neutrality:</strong> Not bound by a specific canon; roles vary by creator, but the meta-idea remains.</li>
              <li><strong>Limits:</strong> Their power is thematic, not absolute—conflicts and balances keep stories interesting.</li>

            Together, figures like INK!Sans and ERROR!Sans form a narrative <strong>tug-of-war</strong> between
            creation and destruction. Their existence explains <em>why</em> AUs can flourish (they are protected)
            and <em>why</em> some collapse (they are targeted or forgotten). This meta-layer connects otherwise
            separate fan works into a coherent multiverse mythos.
