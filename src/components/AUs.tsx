          <p>
            <strong>Alternate Universes (AUs)</strong> are entirely <strong>fan-created variations</strong> of the original UNDERTALE universe. 
            Born from the incredible creativity and passion of the UNDERTALE community, these reimaginings fundamentally 
            change core elements of the game while preserving the characters and themes that make UNDERTALE special.
          </p>

          <div className="au-explanation">
            <h3>How AUs Work:</h3>
            <ul className="explanation-list">
              <li><strong>Character Redesigns:</strong> Same characters, completely different personalities, appearances, or roles</li>
              <li><strong>Setting Changes:</strong> Moving the Underground to space, medieval times, or entirely new dimensions</li>
              <li><strong>Tone Shifts:</strong> Making the world darker, lighter, more comedic, or more serious</li>
              <li><strong>Rule Changes:</strong> Altering the fundamental mechanics of magic, souls, or determination</li>
              <li><strong>Role Swaps:</strong> Characters taking on completely different positions and relationships</li>

            <p>
              What makes UNDERTALE's AU community truly special is its <strong>collaborative nature</strong>. These aren't 
              official expansions or sequels - they're passionate fan projects created by artists, writers, musicians, 
              and game developers who fell in love with Toby Fox's world. The community has produced:
            </p>
            <ul className="community-contributions">
              <li>🎨 <strong>Thousands of original artworks</strong> reimagining characters in new styles</li>
              <li>🎵 <strong>Complete soundtrack remixes</strong> adapting Toby Fox's music to new themes</li>
              <li>📖 <strong>Extensive written stories</strong> exploring character development and world-building</li>
              <li>🎮 <strong>Fan games and interactive experiences</strong> bringing AUs to playable life</li>
              <li>🎭 <strong>Comics and animations</strong> telling stories within these alternate worlds</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The result is a <strong>massive, interconnected multiverse</strong> of creativity that has kept UNDERTALE's 
              spirit alive and growing years after the original game's release.

            <h2>Canon vs Fanon in AUs</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Canon</strong> is what an AU’s original creators explicitly present — their posts, comics,
              games, and stated rules. <strong>Fanon</strong> is the community’s common interpretation: widely shared
              portrayals or headcanons that feel fitting even if they aren’t creator-confirmed. Both are important:
              canon anchors what the AU intends, while fanon fuels remixing and exploration across the fandom. Fanon
              isn’t bad — it reflects community creativity and experimentation; just keep in mind it isn’t official.
            </p>
            <div className="comparison-grid">
              <div className="comparison-item">
                <h4>📘 Canon</h4>
                <p>• Comes from the AU’s creators (official posts, releases, reference sheets, stated rules).</p>
                <p>• Forms the baseline for designs, abilities, tone, and how the AU’s world operates.</p>
              </div>
              <div className="comparison-item">
                <h4>🎨 Fanon</h4>
                <p>• Community portrayals and headcanons that aren’t explicitly confirmed by the creators.</p>
                <p>• Great for fanworks — just remember it’s interpretive, not official.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <h3>★ Example: Storyshift Chara and Knives</h3>
            <p>
              In <strong>CANON Storyshift</strong>, <strong>Chara does not use knives as attacks</strong>.
              However, their <strong>FANON</strong> depiction is often shown <strong>using knives regularly</strong>.
              This page aims to call out such distinctions where relevant so readers know when a detail is
              creator-established or a popular community interpretation.

                Welcome to a twisted reflection of the Underground, where kindness is weakness and survival

                anger, and the harsh reality of their imprisonment. This isn't the hopeful world of mercy and 
                friendship; this is a realm where trust is dangerous and violence is the norm.

                  <li><strong>Undyne:</strong> Even more brutal and militaristic, rules through fear and strength</li>
                  <li><strong>Flowey:</strong> A rare beacon of genuine kindness—actually wants to help and guide you safely through this hostile world</li>
